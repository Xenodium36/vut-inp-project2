* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 1

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
